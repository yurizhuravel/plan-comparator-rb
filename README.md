## comparator-rb

This programm uses data from `plans.json` for its calculation reference, and reads user inputs from a file on `stdin`. The programm takes full path to `plans.json` as an argument. Sample inputs and plans are supplied in `inputs` and `plans.json` files in the root directory of the project.

### Sample usage

`$ ./bin/comparison ./plans.json < inputs`
